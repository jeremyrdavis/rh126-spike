# Raw Idea

Create leaderboard ranking system that calculates scores based on correct answers, implements sorting logic, and exposes RESTful endpoint to retrieve current rankings with usernames and scores.

This is roadmap item 5 from: /Users/jeremyrdavis/Workspace/quarkus-single/agent-os/product/roadmap.md

The feature builds on the existing Answer Submission and Validation feature (item 4) which already tracks user scores in the LeaderboardRepository and LeaderboardService.
