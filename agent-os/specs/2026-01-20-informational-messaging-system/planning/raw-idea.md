## Feature Description

Build randomized message rotation system with three predefined messages about Quarkus/application features, implementing backend logic to randomly select messages and include them in question API responses.

## Source

Roadmap item 6 from: /Users/jeremyrdavis/Workspace/quarkus-single/agent-os/product/roadmap.md

## Additional Context

Note: Looking at the roadmap, this feature is already marked as complete [x]. The EnvironmentRepository was created as part of the Question Display API feature (item 3) which includes randomized informational messages about Quarkus.

This spec will document and verify the existing implementation.
